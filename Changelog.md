# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

* [+] **Garage door: support DASPI "Passage" openers.** Set `"manufacturer": "Daspi"` on a `GarageDoor` device to select its data-points (`dpAction` `1`, `dpStatus` `7`, still overridable). DASPI reports state as strings on DP `7` (`full_opened`/`opening`/`open_softstop`/`full_closed`/`closing`/`close_softstop`) and takes capitalized `Open`/`Close` commands on DP `1`; the soft-stop phases map to HomeKit's Opening/Closing so the tile animates correctly mid-travel.
* [+] **Tuya Cloud is now a transparent, global fallback for every device.** What started as an experiment to reach battery-powered "sleepy" irrigation timers (which never appear on the LAN) is now a general, optional fallback: add a top-level `cloud` credentials block once and the plugin keeps a single Tuya Cloud/MQTT session alive in the background, falling back to it whenever a device can't be reached on the LAN — a flaky moment, or hardware that's never local. The plugin stays **LAN-first** (local is always tried first and preferred) and cloud remains **strictly opt-in** (nothing runs unless credentials are present).
  * **No per-device configuration.** There is one global session and no per-device cloud settings. Every device automatically uses the LAN first and the cloud as a fallback; a device with no local `key` is reached over the cloud only. Existing LAN configs (numeric data-points) keep working over the cloud — the data-point id↔code map is learned from Tuya's device shadow (`/v2.0/cloud/thing/{id}/shadow/properties`) — and if both transports fail, HomeKit shows "No Response" as before. This mirrors the official Tuya/Smart Life app (LAN when possible, cloud as a backup).
  * Realtime updates arrive over Tuya's **MQTT** message service (via the optional `mqtt` dependency, installed automatically); initial state and control use the Tuya OpenAPI. There is no polling.
  * Works with both **Custom** and **Smart Home** Cloud projects (the latter via app-account login).
  * The **IrrigationSystem** accessory no longer has any cloud-specific handling — like every other accessory it's transport-agnostic, with the LAN+cloud fallback handled underneath.
  * If your devices sometimes drop off the LAN and show "No Response", adding cloud credentials is an easy way to smooth that over. See the wiki: **[Tuya Cloud Setup](https://github.com/adrianjagielak/homebridge-tuya-plus/blob/main/wiki/Tuya-Cloud-Setup.md)**.
* [*] **Fix realtime (MQTT) cloud updates being silently dropped** — external changes (physical buttons, the Tuya app, the device's own timers) now show up in HomeKit within a second or two. The decryptor was verifying the AES-GCM auth tag (`decipher.final()`), but Tuya's real status frames don't carry a tag that verifies against the documented AAD, so every realtime message was being thrown away. Now decrypts with `update()` only, matching the official `tuya/tuya-homebridge` and `0x5e/homebridge-tuya-platform` implementations.
* [*] **Fix cloud irrigation valves that could be turned on but not off** — the per-zone write coalescer was dropping any command that matched the last-known `device.state`. Cloud devices never optimistically advance `state` (it only moves once the realtime stream confirms the device), so an "off" issued before the "on" was echoed matched the stale "off" and was discarded — HomeKit showed the zone closed while it kept running. Queued commands are now sent as-is (callers already queue only genuine changes).
* [*] **IrrigationSystem: remove the rain sensor.** It never reported reliably on these devices, and bundling a sensor (a different HomeKit category) in the same accessory forced the Home app to fragment the sprinkler into "sub-accessories" — blocking control from the main tile and hiding the system master on/off. The accessory is now a single, clean sprinkler tile (IrrigationSystem + valves + optional battery); any leftover Contact/Leak sensor service from a previous build is removed automatically on restart. The `noRainSensor`, `rainSensorType`, `rainInverted`, `dpRain` and `rainOnValue` options are gone.
* [*] **IrrigationSystem: add the HAP Service Label service for multi-valve controllers** — an accessory that exposes a collection of same-type services (more than one `Valve`) must include a `ServiceLabel` service to anchor each valve's `ServiceLabelIndex`. It was missing, so stricter Home app clients (notably iOS) scattered the zones as separate tiles instead of nesting them under the single irrigation tile. The service is added automatically (with the Arabic-numerals namespace) whenever there is more than one valve; user-set zone names still take precedence.
* [*] **IrrigationSystem: stop the valve toggle flickering after a press** — tapping a zone briefly snapped back to the old state before settling on the new one. The `Active` getters returned the raw `device.state`, which (for cloud devices) only advances once the realtime stream echoes the write back, so a read in that window reported the pre-press value. The getters now report the value HomeKit already shows (optimistic on press, then confirmed/corrected by device-side change events); they still surface "No Response" while disconnected.
* [*] **Tuya Cloud: report real device online/offline status.** Cloud devices previously always showed as reachable. They now mirror Tuya's `online` flag (read from the device record on connect and re-checked when the realtime stream reconnects), so HomeKit shows **"No Response"** when the device is genuinely offline. If the lookup isn't permitted (the project lacks the device-management API), the device is assumed reachable so control is never blocked.
* [*] **Signal unreachable devices with `HapStatusError`.** The shared getters (`getStateAsync` / `getDividedStateAsync`, used by nearly every accessory's read handlers, plus the irrigation `Active` getter) threw a plain `Error` to make HomeKit show "No Response". Newer Homebridge logs a characteristic warning for that before falling back to a generic status; they now throw `HapStatusError(SERVICE_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE)` directly — same "No Response", no warning spam. No behaviour change for users.
* [*] **Surface write and connection failures to HomeKit, universally across device types.** Previously a command sent to an unreachable device was silently dropped while HomeKit still reported the tap as successful, and several accessories kept showing their last-known state instead of going "No Response" — the clearest example was a LAN gate that logged `skipping write, device not connected` yet still appeared online and "accepted" open/close taps. Now:
  * **Writes** to a disconnected device (or a write the device/cloud rejects) fail the HomeKit operation instead of pretending success. The shared write helpers (`setState` / `setMultiState` / `setMultiStateLegacy` and their `*Async` variants) now signal a communication failure, so accessories whose set handlers swallowed it (garage door, switches/outlets, RGB hue + saturation, blinds, vertical-tilt blinds) report it on a tap.
  * **Reads** that returned a cached/optimistic or constant value (brightness, colour, hue/saturation, blind position/state, garage-door state, valve in-use/duration, heater state, …) now report **"No Response"** when the device is unreachable — matching the read handlers that already did.
  * **Cloud** commands that fail over HTTP (a network error, or a command Tuya rejects) are surfaced too: `TuyaCloudDevice.update()` now resolves to the real command result so the write helper can await it, rather than firing and forgetting.
  * Internal/background writes (auto-shutoff timers, multi-step open/close sequences, debounced batches) stay non-fatal via dedicated non-throwing helpers (`setStateInBackground` / `setMultiStateInBackground` / `setMultiStateLegacyInBackground`), so an unreachable device can never crash Homebridge with an unhandled error.
